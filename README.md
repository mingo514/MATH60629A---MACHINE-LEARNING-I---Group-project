# Paper Title: How Can Integration of Explainability Tools and Dimensionality Reduction Techniques Improve the Interpretability of PCA

## Overview
This project aims to enhance the interpretability of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by integrating explainability tools and advanced dimensionality reduction techniques. By combining PCA with methods like UMAP and t-SNE, and utilizing explainability tools, this project provides deeper insights into data structure and the significance of principal components.

## Features
- **Explainability Integration:** Tools that elucidate PCA results, offering a clearer understanding of component makeup.
- **Advanced Dimensionality Reduction:** Comparison and implementation of PCA with UMAP and t-SNE.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Evaluation of different techniques for their effectiveness in various scenarios.

## Installation
